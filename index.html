<p>Hey LogganSWE,</p>

<p>Please do not implement any features that go against our ToU. Using the .dlls is fine (use at own risk!) and it may greatly help people. However, including features that will show you who you are playing against in ARAM is something or unlocking your lock is something we do not want to endorse.</p>
<p>Other than that, keep up the support you give people on this page! Kudos to you!</p>
